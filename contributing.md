## 🧩 Guidelines

✅ Keep it **simple and beginner-friendly**.
✅ Use **consistent formatting** — each term starts with a title, definition, and optional use cases.
✅ Avoid overly long text; aim for 3–8 sentences per term.
✅ Add links only when necessary (official AWS docs preferred).
✅ Do **not** copy-paste text directly from AWS docs; paraphrase in your own words.
